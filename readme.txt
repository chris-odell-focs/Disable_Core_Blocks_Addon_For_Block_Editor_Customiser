Disable core blocks to restrict users to certain features.

== Description ==

This is an addon for the Block Editor Customiser which allows you to hide core blocks in the Editor.
Please be aware it is possible to make them visible again if the user has access to the 'Show more tools and options'
menu where they can select the 'Block Manager' to reactivate the blocks hidden by this addon.

If you do not want this to happen the only way of preventing it is to hide the 'Show more tools and options' menu item which can
be done from the main settings page in the Block Editor Customiser.

If you want to deactivate or uninstall this addon, then please uncheck all block types that have
been checked, save the changes, and open a post or page before deactivation, otherwise any block types that have
been previously hidden will remain hidden unless displayed using the 'Block Manager' mentioned above.

** NOTE: ** This plugin requires version 1.6+ of the Foxdell Folio Block Editor Customiser to work.
